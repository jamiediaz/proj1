# Project 1: 
## Weather and Data

### Description
We are attempting to determine if there is a correlation between the peak temperatures and crime rate in Harris County. 
Crime data was taken from FBI.gov spanning 21 years from 2007 to 2017.  It was then compared to the average and peak yearly 
temperatures in the area for the same time period. 

A study simillar to this was also performed in much more nothern areas like Baltimore, MD which gave the inspiration for this study. 

### Conclusion
What we found is that there wasn't any correlation between weather and crime rate in Harris County. We think that it is due to 
the temperature being fairly constant, eventhough Harris County much more extreme high temperatures than Baltimore.  

We also did a test between crime rate and median household income and we found significance.  It appears that when the income 
goes up, so does the crime rate.
